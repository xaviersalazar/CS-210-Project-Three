# CS-210-Project-Three
- Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

  `The project was to create a terminal based program that could track their items throughout the day based on a record file that is generated. It also used C++ with Python to achieve this.`
  
- What did you do particularly well?

  `I've used Python before in different projects so that was something I was already pretty familiar and good with. I think my previous knowledge of Python helped me alot in that part of the codebase.`

- Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  `I think one of the biggest enhancements could be the potential use of an actual UI. We use the terminal here which does okay but formatting the terminal output can be a pain sometimes. And that's not considering the size of the users terminal or their other settings like fonts, font size, etc. `
  
- Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

  `In terms of actual code, I've never written C++ code to read from a file so that was the only part I would consider maybe challenging. I don't have much experience with C++ outside the class setting so I used the textbook for class and stackoverflow as a resource for specific coding issues I had.`
  
- What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  `We learned the basics from this class of C++, an object-oriented language. I think those basics can be transferred to almost any other project or course work that invovles programming. The basics of a lot of languages are very similar so I think the skills we learn here can sort of cut our learning curve for a new langauge we might be learning on a different project or course work.`
  
- How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  `The project had some guidelines already set in place that we had to follow that adhered to best practices and code quality. But I also things such as comments to describe some of my logic and made sure my code was readable by ensuring I had the correct number of tabs, spaces, etc. This also makes the program adaptable and easy for another developer to use.`
